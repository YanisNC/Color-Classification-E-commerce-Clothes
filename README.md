# Color-Classification-E-commerce-Clothes

- To face this unsupervised learning problem, I’ve used a dataset that contains 5000 unlabeled images.
- I’ve used the K-Means algorithm to cluster the N dominant colors of the images.
- Finally, we use a threshold, in the HSV color space, for the color that we want to detect from all the clothes.
- If any of the N dominant colors is inside this threshold, it’s classified as this color.
